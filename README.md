This is Movie-Rater.  The idea behind this application was to have a space where a user could add and keep track of various movies they've watched, as well as rate those movies for future context.  The app includes the a form to add new movies to the list, as well as a list page that shows all the currently added movies.  This list can be sorted in various ways, and it can also be searched.  When clicking on a specific movie, you'll be taken to that movies info page which includes things such as runtime, stars and director, as well as a poster for the movie, and an embedded youtube video containing the trailer for that movie.

### `npm install`

### `npm run server`

Runs our custom built json database, which contains the info for all of the movies currently added by the user.  There is seed data already in the database as a jumping off point

### `npm start`
